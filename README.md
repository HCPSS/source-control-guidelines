# Source Control Guidelines
Programming is hard. The simplest mistake can cause catastrophic failure. As developers, engineers, and programmers, we are expected to work independently with little oversight or audit to solve problems through software while maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of millions of data for thousands of users.

We need source control to do our jobs. We must know why software is the way it is and how we can change it to make it better. And when we have questions, we need access to resources where we might find answers.

We have many tools at our disposal that are designed to help us. But without clear guidance and a shared understanding of how to use these tools, we will spend a lot of time lost in fruitless searches or writing documentation that may never be read. These guidelines exist to establish and communicate a clear understanding of how we implement source control.

### Developers should be free to express ideas, solve problems, and generate code with minimal administrative overhead



### Code should be organized and accessible



### Documentation should be precise and pithy, not redundant or wordy



### Tell us where your secrets are, not what your secrets are



### Use change management
